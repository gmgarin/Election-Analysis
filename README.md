Module 3 Python Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
### The purpose of this election audit is to summarized the results and obtain additional important information needed by the Colorado Board of Election.

Specifically, the election commision wants to know the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Results
### Using Python script, the data was analyzed and showed the following results:

      - Arapahoe: 24,801 (6.7%)
  - The county with the largest voter turnout is Denver.

## Election-Audit Summary
### In conclusion, running a Python script is an efficient and effective way of analyzing vast amount of data gathered during election season. It can be modified in many different ways depending on the needed information and available data. For example, in future elections, Python script can also be modified to identify the breakdwon of the numbers of how people voted (i.e. mail, early voting, and election day voting). It can also used to detect potential irregularities like duplicate votes etc.
